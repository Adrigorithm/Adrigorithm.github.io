## Overview
My website is a can be seen as extended version of a digital CV. It includes my interests, skills and so on. It's built using HTML, CSS [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and a touch of JavaScript (mainly used to generate dynamic content from JSON files and APIs).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-static-website.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally (although it would be better to run a webserver).

## Usage
- Navigate through the different sections using the menu.
- Check out my project showcases and baking recipes :)
- Feel free to explore the codeâ€”it's all open source!

## Contributing
I do not accept contributions in the form of code of PRs. If you however have suggestiongs, they are welcome (create an issue for it).

## Contact
Feel free to reach out to me via email (it should be on GitHub - or on this pages website) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a3w/).
